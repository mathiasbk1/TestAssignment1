## Assignment 1

### Reflections
#### Shooting
* The shot did not hit
* The shot did not hit any vital part of the man
* The man was wearing kevlar
* It was a BB gun
* The shooting was next to a hospital
* etc. 

#### Alien 
Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise.
Squeeze the toothpaste container to apply a pea-sized dollop on top of the hairy head of the toothbrush.
Open mouth and insert the toothbrush.
Run the bristles of the toothbrush on each tooth, in a circular and vibrating motion, applying moderate force.  
Rinse mouth and toothbrush with clean water. 


### Thoughts on TDD
#### Positive
* Verifiable code quality, can run on each change to the program
* May have written more tests than usually

#### Negative
For simple tasks such as converting temperatures or roman numerals, writing 1 test at a time and implementing for that specific test each cycle (red, green, refactor) is time-consuming and doesn't yield any real benefit; Writing a input1MustReturnI() test for roman numerals and implementing simply {return "I"} doesn't make sense, since I already know it will fail down the line. Might as well write and implement multiple tests per cycle for simple operations. Could make sense for implementing more complex methods, or methods that increase in complexity over time but start out simple (requirements change). 

#### Surprises
None, really. 

#### Did it help write tests I wouldn't have thought of otherwise?
Not for these tasks.
